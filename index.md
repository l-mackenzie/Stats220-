# My Meme
>  The **newness** and **originality** of this meme may be debatable. 
However, when we ignore the format and cat theme, this meme drills down into my own personal experiences and fears.

_What could be more original that that?_

* You may notice a jarring yellow and grey combination when next to the distraught cat, recognising that they must revist SQL. I used this to structure my dislike towards query languages with a gross colo**u**r. 

* Pink and green is my favourite colo**u**r combination, so naturally I had to use this for the text around my excited cat. 

# My R Code

When making this meme, it was very important that I had [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) installed in my R studio.

Some of the motivations behind this meme i made were:
1. I once had to learn SQL over zoom and couldn't access it on my computer for various technical issues, naturally I am now very scared of this acronym
2. I like cats
3. I dont like the colo**u**r yellow
4. I like pink and green combined ðŸ˜Ž
